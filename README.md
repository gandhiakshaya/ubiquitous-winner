geolocation tracking -
This web site is to show location of a user on map im planning to add more to it later 
currently i can't test this web app on mobile because local host doesn't have
https in its url so geolocation doesn't return it gives error atleast that's what
i think (I'm a beginner ;) ) so i'm posting  this website here for testing purposes.
Thank You.
